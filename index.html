      <div class="content">Swimming is an Olympic aquatic sport that involves swimming over various distances in the shortest possible time.</div>

      <h3 class="header">Section 2</h3>
      <div class="content">It's generally accepted that the first swimming competitions date back to the 16th century, but competitive swimming received its real boost in the late 19th century with the advent of artificial swimming pools. It's noteworthy that the development of the sport is closely linked to the rise of the Olympic movement. Swimming debuted at the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens. At that time, competitions were held in open water in the Zeya harbor in four events: the 100-, 500-, and 1200-meter men's sprints, with no strict stroke requirements, and a separate 100-meter sprint for sailors. The hero of the inaugural Olympics in swimming was Hungarian Alfréd Hajós, who won gold in both the 100- and 1200-meter events. Four years later, in Paris, on the River Seine, Olympians competed for seven sets of medals, including in disciplines that now seem exotic – diving, team swimming, and even obstacle swimming.</div>

      <h3 class="header">Section3</h3>
      <div class="content">A major step forward was made in 1908, with the founding of the International Swimming Federation (FINA). Rules were also approved, including the list of distances for competitions and their structure. The early 20th century also saw the recording and registration of world records in swimming. Incidentally, the first officially recognized world record holder was four-time Olympic champion Zoltan Halmai of Hungary, who swam the 100-meter freestyle in 1:5.8 seconds. And the important psychological barrier of one minute in the 100-meter freestyle was first surpassed by five-time Olympic champion Johnny Weissmuller of the United States (58.6 in 1922), who later became famous for his role as Tarzan in the movies.</div>
